- Set up comprehensive logging system
- Create configuration management system

**Phase 2: Data Collection System**
- Implement YFinance collector for 20+ years historical data
- Build Riksbanken API client for Swedish economic data
- Create SCB API client for housing/demographic data
- Implement data validation and cleaning pipelines
- Set up efficient data storage with proper indexing

**Phase 3: Analysis Engine**
- Technical analysis: Moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- Fundamental analysis: Economic indicator correlations
- Risk metrics: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, VaR, correlation matrices
- Market regime detection algorithms
- Seasonal pattern analysis

**Phase 4: AI-Powered Optimization**
